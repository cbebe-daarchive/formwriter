Weekly Assignment 6: Serial Counter

Included files:
serial_counter.cpp
README
Makefile

Wiring Instructions:
Arduino Pin 9 <--> Longer LED lead | Red LED | Shorter LED lead <--> Resistor <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 10 <--> Longer LED lead | Red LED | Shorter LED lead <--> Resistor <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 11 <--> Longer LED lead | Green LED | Shorter LED lead <--> Resistor <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 12 <--> Longer LED lead | Red LED | Shorter LED lead <--> Resistor <--> Arduino GND
Arduino Pin 13 <--> Longer LED lead | Red LED | Shorter LED lead <--> Resistor <--> Arduino GND

Running Instructions:
1. Wire the Arduino as instructed and plug into the computer.
2. Open  the terminal on the cmput274 virtual machine. Navigate to the location of “serial_counter.cpp”.
    Make sure that the "Makefile" file is in the same directory as the program
3. Type on the command line:
    "make upload" to upload the program to the Arduino.
4. Type on the command line:
    "serial-mon" to open the serial monitor.

Notes and Assumptions:
This program implements a serial counter for the Arduino. Any hexadecimal value typed on the serial monitor
will be added to an unsigned 8-bit integer total and the 5 least significant bits will be represented using the 5 LED lights.
This program however cannot represent numbers greater that 2^5-1 as there are only 5 LED lights.
This can be solved by adding more LED lights to represent more bits.
